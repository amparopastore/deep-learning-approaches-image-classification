# Deep Learning Models for Image Classification

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the development and evaluation of deep learning models for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. It covers several models, including those using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

## Contents

### 1. Preliminaries
The notebook starts with importing necessary libraries and defining the model architectures.

### 2. Model Architectures
- **RNN Model**: Uses Embedding and LSTM layers for sequence processing.
- **CNN Classifier v1**: Basic CNN model with multiple convolutional layers and pooling layers.
- **CNN Classifier v2**: Enhanced CNN model with Dropout and Batch Normalization.
- **CNN Classifier v3**: Advanced CNN model with data augmentation techniques.

### 3. Data Processing
- **Data Preparation**: Creation of training, validation, and test datasets.
- **ImageDataGenerator**: Utilized for data augmentation and preprocessing.

### 4. Training
- **Model Training**: Detailed training process for each model including epochs, batch size, and validation metrics.

### 5. Evaluation
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation of the trained models on test data.
